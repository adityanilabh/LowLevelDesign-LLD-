Design an interface Character with methods attack() and defend().
Create a concrete class Warrior that implements the Character interface. Warriors have a strong attack and moderate defense.
Create a concrete class Mage that implements the Character interface. Mages have a magical attack and weak defense.
Implement a CharacterFactory interface with a factory method createCharacter().
Create a concrete factory class WarriorFactory that implements the CharacterFactory interface. It should return a Warrior instance.
Create a concrete factory class MageFactory that implements the CharacterFactory interface. It should return a Mage instance.
In the main game code, use the factory methods to create instances of Warrior and Mage. Test their abilities by calling attack() and defend().
