Imagine you are designing a system for an online zoo, 
where different types of animals are housed in specific 
enclosures based on their habitats. Each habitat has its 
own set of animals, including carnivores and herbivores. 
Implement the Abstract Factory pattern to create families of animals 
for different habitats.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. first create zoofactory interface.- it is a default factory interface.
2. create class of name savannahfactory and aquiriumFactory from zoofactory.
3. create an interface name carnivores and herbivores and specify it's property method name
4. now create land and ocean organism that implement these above two interface.
5. create zoo application file and run the application.
